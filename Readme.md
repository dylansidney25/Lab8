This lab is meant to demonstrate the functionality of controling motors with
the Pi Versus the Arduino as well as show how to use sliders and their values
within python. Controling motors with the Pi is more complicated that 
controling them with adruino and not as effective. the arduino has a smooth
control over the motor where the pi cant always supply enought current or as
steady of a voltage causing the motors to be twitchy.
